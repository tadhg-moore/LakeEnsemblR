\title{Export LakeEnsemblR standardized input to model specific driver format}
\usage{
export_inflow(
  config_file,
  model = c("GOTM", "GLM", "Simstrat", "FLake", "MyLake"),
  inflow_file = NULL,
  scale_param = NULL,
  folder = ".",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{config_file}{filepath; to LakeEnsemblr yaml master config file}

\item{model}{vector; model to export driving data. Options include
c('GOTM', 'GLM', 'Simstrat', 'FLake')}

\item{inflow_file}{filepath; to inflow file which is in the standardised LakeEnsemblR format.}

\item{scale_param}{dataframe; with column names referring to standard names in LER.
Scales meteorological value according to value in the column. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{folder}{filepath; to folder which contains the model folders generated by export_config()}

\item{use_outflows}{logical; adds an artificial outflow matching the inflow discharge when
TRUE Defaults to FALSE.}
